# Participants
This directory contains scripts for a realistic demo with real timings.

Each script runs an agent for a prediction market participant (e.g. a
household, person, organization, ...). These scripts should be run on a
VM e.g. using screen. Make sure that accounts given to the agents
correspond to accounts on Ganache.
